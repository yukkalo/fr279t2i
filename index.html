    Floating Utopia is a phygital environment and ecosystem that lives and expands with new scenarios. The geological properties and surfaces of the new created environment will become the results of machine terraforming, they will be reconstructed through the visible and invisible representations of attentive machines about the spaces of reality. 
Working as a digital ruinologists, we trust the reconstruction of the spaces that reveal us and the scenarios of our existence to non-human actors. We are interested in what they can assemble from the survived fragments and how these pieces can be glued together. 
Reality is semi-real. The boundaries of its biological and digital body are similar to the surface of swamps, in terms of their blurriness - zones of geological instability, floating boundaries between land and water, and, at the same time, natural ecotones - sources of biodiversity and places of stress, where ecosystems collide and various ways of species coexistence occur. In the project we consider big data as a new ecotone and resource for restoration, a digital swamp, inhabited by a variety of myths and weird inhabitants - datasets involved in rehearsing the end of the world and visualizing its recovery.
